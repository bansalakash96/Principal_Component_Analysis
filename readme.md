Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique in the field of
data analysis and dimensionality reduction. Itâ€™s particularly effective for reducing the dimensionality
of large datasets while preserving the essential information. PCA accomplishes this
by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, called principal components,
which are linear combinations of the original variables.
Lanczos method can also be used to perform PCA in a computationally efficient manner.
